See the ThemeSolutions.pdf for details on solving the puzzle levels.

When building levels, enabled/active tiles are shown in a dark black outline.
Pressing preview will make the conventions more clear.

When building theme levels, words must be placed one per line in the word box
on the right. On theme levels, ensure that all enabled tiles have an assigned
letter so that you can save the level and go back to the screen. It will not
allow you to go back until you have rectified this issue.
